                “THE BOOK CHINA DOESN'T WANT YOU TO READ.”—CNN​
              </div>
              <div class="right_side details summery">
                A riveting insider's story of how the Party and big money work
                in China today, by a man who, with his wife, Whitney Duan, rose
                to the zenith of power and wealth—and then fell out of favor.
                She was disappeared four years ago. News of this book led to a
                phone call from Whitney, proof that she's alive.

              <div class="right_side details description">
                As Desmond Shum was growing up impoverished in China, he vowed
                his life would be different.
                <br /><br />

                Through hard work and sheer tenacity he earned an American
                college degree and returned to his native country to establish
                himself in business. There, he met his future wife, the highly
                intelligent and equally ambitious Whitney Duan who was
                determined to make her mark within China’s male-dominated
                society. Whitney and Desmond formed an effective team and, aided
                by relationships they formed with top members of China’s
                Communist Party, the so-called red aristocracy, he vaulted into
                China’s billionaire class. Soon they were developing the massive
                air cargo facility at Beijing International Airport, and they
                followed that feat with the creation of one of Beijing’s premier
                hotels. They were dazzlingly successful, traveling in private
                jets, funding multi-million-dollar buildings and endowments, and
                purchasing expensive homes, vehicles, and art.<br /><br />

                But in 2017, their fates diverged irrevocably when Desmond,
                while residing overseas with his son, learned that his now
                ex-wife Whitney had vanished along with three coworkers.
                <br /><br />
                This is both Desmond’s story and Whitney’s, because she has not
                been able to tell it herself. <br /><br />
